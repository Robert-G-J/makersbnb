Listing:
```
As a hard-up room-letter (or kingpin landlord),
So that I can get a little extra income,
I want to list a room for let.
```
Book Listings:
```
As a traveller,
So I can stay in local place,
I want to book a listing.

As a user,
To avoid booking stress,
I want double-booking a room to be impossible

As a room-letter,
So that I can tidy up before a traveller arrives,
I want to know when a room has been booked.
```
